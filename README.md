[#2: ANOTHER DEMO: Noise in container](http://ezekielaquino.com/Noise3000/index2.html)


## Why?
Because Why Not‚Ñ¢? Sometimes grain can be good. Get that paper, film, tangible feels pain-free and performant.

[#2: ANOTHER DEMO: Noise in container](http://ezekielaquino.com/Noise3000/index2.html)

## What?
Noise3000 basically creates a `noisy` element and is added either to the page or to a specified container. The grain is then animated via requestAnimationFrame using 3D transforms. Everything you need is contained in this ~8kb minified package, only thing you need to do is plop it in!


## Usage
Download or `npm install noise3000` then simply call `Noise3k` like below: (you can also pass in a few options)

```js
  Noise3k({
    container: '#element', // (optional || default: document.body) specify where the noise is applied
    grainSize: 1, // (optional || default: 1) Multiplier for the grain size
  });
```


## Notes
- Play around with the grainSize to achieve your desired result.
- Different colors react differently with the grain. I've found that highly saturated colors tend to make the grain less visible. I'm still experimenting on which type of noise is best.
